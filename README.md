# JS DOCUMENT – RESPONSIVE WEB DESIGN COURSE

A simple HTML & CSS build of a JS document. This was a real easy build as I have already learnt these codes.

I enjoyed designing the nav bar layout for this one, I really like the layout and style of this page.
This is the forth notable proof of work from the FREE CODE CAMP COURSE – RESPONSIVE WEB DESIGN.
